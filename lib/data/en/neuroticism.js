  title: "Neuroticism",
  shortDescription:
    "Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings.",
  description: `<strong>HIGH SCORE</strong><br />
  Highly neurotic individuals are emotionally reactive and prone to stress. They show an increased tendency to experience unremarkable situations as threats, or minor frustrations as hopelessly difficult obstacles. They may more often experience emotions such as fear, anger, or sadness. Their negative feelings tend to persist for longer periods, meaning they're often in a bad mood. This may be compounded by frequent chronic tension causing frequent feelings of fatigue caused by, for example, experiencing anxiety. These problems with emotional regulation can reduce the ability of a person high on this scale to think clearly, as well as make decision-making difficult. As a result, people with high levels of neuroticism often visibly struggle with stress and worry. However, this gives them a certain vigilance that allows them to better predict and prepare for difficulties in life in some situations. People with high neuroticism strive for safety and are well-equipped to maintain their current situation. <br /><br />
  <strong>AVERAGE SCORE</strong><br />
  People with average levels of neuroticism find themselves "in between" - they have a balanced view of emotions, both past and upcoming. Sometimes they're sad and irritated, but they probably have a reason for it. Their self-esteem remains at a normal level. They balance between safety and risk that might help improve their life situation. They can adapt to various situations. <br /><br />
  <strong>LOW SCORE</strong><br />
  People with low levels of neuroticism are more emotionally stable and less reactive. Time pressure or stress doesn't cause such an increase in their heart rate. They're often characterised by mental resilience and a balanced, regulated approach to their own emotions.
