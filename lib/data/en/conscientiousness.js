  shortDescription:
    "Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.",
  description: `<strong>HIGH SCORE</strong><br />
  A highly conscientious person can act in line with a long-term plan - even if impulses tempt them to do something else momentarily. A conscientious person will choose distant success (e.g. better grades or health) at the cost of short-term pleasure (e.g. a party or fast food). They tend to maintain order and will calmly carry out various resolutions, even if some elements might prove boring or tedious. High conscientiousness helps avoid problems and build credibility with others; one gains a reputation as a 'trustworthy' person. It may be linked to professional or academic achievements. <br />
  High conscientiousness involves decisive action, avoiding procrastination, and not making excuses. People with high scores on this scale will excel in administrative or managerial roles. <br />
  Unfortunately, high conscientiousness can go hand in hand with perfectionism or workaholism. People with such results may experience failures intensely and be very critical of both themselves and others. They're prone to shame and self-disappointment. They show tendencies to demand personal responsibility and excessive control - both of themselves and others. Extremely conscientious people may also have social difficulties - besides potential attempts to 'manage' others, they may be perceived as 'rigid' or uninteresting. <br /><br />
  <strong>AVERAGE SCORE</strong><br />
  Average conscientiousness means a tendency to thoughtfully carry out plans, but with a 'margin for impulsivity' to be able to deviate from the planned scenario in case of a sudden idea or interest. Shame or self-dislike occurs less often, as does disappointment with one's own ineffectiveness. Such a person achieves their goals and resolutions, but not at all costs. <br /><br />
  <strong>LOW SCORE</strong><br />
  A person with low conscientiousness (also sometimes called impulsive or 'undirected') will struggle with difficulties in carrying out long-term plans. Often they don't have such plans at all, and may not have clearly defined goals in life. They may regularly have to deal with the consequences of earlier, ill-considered behaviours. The achievements of a person with low conscientiousness tend to be small, inconsistent, and scattered. They lack the determination and focus to turn them into something more in a traditional way. It also happens that such individuals are accompanied in life by a reputation of being unreliable or lacking ambition. They struggle with maintaining attention and disciplined action. Hedonistic tendencies may appear.
