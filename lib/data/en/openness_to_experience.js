  title: "Openness To Experience",
  shortDescription:
    "Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people.",
  description: `<strong>HIGH SCORE</strong><br />
  People open to experiences are curious about the world, appreciate art, and are sensitive to beauty. They're often aware of their feelings or opinions and show interest in their "inner life". They tend to have unconventional beliefs - this stems from their individualistic and non-conformist thinking. They're often called creative or visionary. They tend to be interested in various things and acquire new skills in life. They can see familiar things in a completely new way. Sometimes they pursue change for the sake of change itself. <br />
  Another feature of an open cognitive style is the ability to think in symbols and abstractions that are far from concrete things or phenomena. Depending on the individual's intellectual abilities and preferences, this symbolic thinking can take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking; it can also manifest as artistic talent, realised socially or independently. <br />
  All this may go hand in hand with difficulty coping with the routine of daily life. People with high openness to experience may generate an excessive number of solutions to problems, approach the simplest issues overly creatively, or fail to fit into the company hierarchy. They show problems with repetitive, routine activities. They can easily "start a business", but running it later may prove challenging. They may also have problems choosing a single career path in life. Implementing ideas into reality is not their strong suit. <br /><br />
  <strong>AVERAGE SCORE</strong><br />
  People with average scores will show feelings and thinking that fall "between" these two extremes. On one hand, they'll be focused on practical action, and on the other - quite ready for unconventional proposals and seeking new solutions and possibilities. They may be attached to their routines, but won't resist considering how to improve or change them. <br /><br />
  <strong>LOW OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE</strong><br />
  People with low scores in openness to experience tend to have narrow interests or competencies. They're pragmatic. They prefer what's simple, clear, and obvious, rather than what's complicated, ambiguous, and subtle. They may approach art and science with suspicion, treating them as too abstract or impractical. Closed people prefer what's familiar. They're often reluctant to change. An unexpected event can cause them anxiety. <br /><br />
  <strong>OTHER CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />
  Open and closed thinking styles are useful in different environments. The creative style of an open person may serve a professor or creative director well, but closed thinking is associated with better performance in police work, sales, and many service professions. <br />
  A duo of an open and a closed person can also - but only together - create a good team for founding a so-called "startup". One person will visionary devise the next steps of development, while the other will ensure that it's a sensible and realistic action plan.

Intellect love to play with ideas. They are open-minded to new and unusual
ideas, and like to debate intellectual issues. They enjoy riddles, puzzles,
and brain teasers. Low scorers on Intellect prefer dealing with either
people or things rather than ideas. They regard intellectual exercises as a
waste of time. Intellect should not be equated with intelligence.
Intellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability, although
high scorers on Intellect score slightly higher than low-Intellect

hostility toward rules, sympathy for law-breakers, and love of ambiguity,
chaos, and disorder. Psychological conservatives prefer the security and
stability brought by conformity to tradition. Psychological liberalism
and conservatism are not identical to political affiliation, but certainly
incline individuals toward certain political parties.`,
