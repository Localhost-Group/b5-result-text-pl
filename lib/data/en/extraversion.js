    "Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world.",
  description: `<strong>HIGH SCORE</strong><br />
  People characterised by high extraversion (and thus, low introversion) are usually enthusiastic, action-oriented, and inclined to say "Yes!" or "Let's go!" to situations that might result in shared emotional experiences. They thrive in groups, valuing assertive conversations and attracting others' attention. They enjoy planning parties, telling stories, and making others laugh. They're often "first to act", especially if supported by corresponding results from other scales. They draw energy from social interactions and need social contact to feel satisfied and emotionally "charged". <br />
  Extraverts are enthusiastic workers - they're well-suited for sales, marketing, group work, or public speaking. Solitary work (such as running a one-person business developing applications) can cause them great discomfort. They're easily distracted by other people and may dominate others. <br /><br />
  <strong>AVERAGE SCORE</strong><br />
  Finding oneself near the "middle" of this spectrum means readiness for both forms of social activity. Such a person will feel comfortable both at a party (as long as it's not too often) and in the solitude of their home (as long as it's not too often). <br /><br />
  <strong>LOW SCORE</strong><br />
  People with low scores on this scale (i.e., introverts) often don't "catch up" with extraverts in terms of energy and activity levels. They tend to be subdued and thoughtful people, sometimes even disengaged from the social world. Their lack of social engagement shouldn't be interpreted as shyness or depression: an introvert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert, and spending time without company is very valuable to them. <br />
  Highly introverted individuals draw energy from solitude and inner reflections. They enjoy the company of others but greatly appreciate the time and space that allow them to recharge their "social batteries". They tend to be cautious in new behaviours and focused on what they're doing. <br />
  The social independence and "withdrawal" of an introvert are sometimes misinterpreted as arrogance or dislike for others. In reality, an introvert who, for example, also scores high on the agreeableness dimension, won't actively seek contact with others, but in any subsequent interaction that occurs with their consent, they may prove to be an engaged, friendly person. Professionally, they'll be most comfortable in work that doesn't require them to be "exposed" to many, especially new, interpersonal contacts. Careers requiring solitude and focus will likely suit them.
