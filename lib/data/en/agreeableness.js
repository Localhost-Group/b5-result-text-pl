  title: "Agreeableness",
  shortDescription:
    "Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.",
  description: `<strong>HIGH SCORE</strong><br />
  People with high agreeableness are often polite, friendly, and willing to compromise in their relationships. They care about helping others and are often generous and nurturing. They trust easily and have an optimistic view of human nature. They believe that others are generally honest, decent, and trustworthy. However, this can come at the cost of neglecting their own needs or priorities, or hiding their true views. They tend to avoid conflicts and may violate their own boundaries. They may also show a greater-than-average desire to be liked or respected. Such people might promise more than they can deliver, which can be problematic in business when they fail to meet previously agreed, yet exaggerated goals. <br />
  With such a result, it's important to note that a polite and kind approach doesn't rule out setting boundaries and saying no. You can maintain harmony in a group whilst standing your ground through assertiveness, empathy, and good communication. <br /><br />
  <strong>AVERAGE SCORE</strong><br />
  People with average agreeableness are relatively cooperative and tolerant, but they can also stand their ground. They adapt to the situation. Sometimes they choose submissiveness and peace. Other times, they choose conflict and dominance. They combine the ability to empathise with socially excluded individuals with vigilance not to be exploited by disagreeable people with bad intentions. Through their readiness to engage in difficult discussions, they can disrupt short-term harmony, e.g. in a relationship with someone, to quickly solve a problem. This is productive as it prevents various resentments from 'building up' over time. <br /><br />
  <strong>LOW SCORE</strong><br />
  People with low agreeableness (sometimes called 'antagonistic') often put their own interests (or planned projects) above good relationships with others. Colloquially speaking: they 'deliver' what's needed, even at the cost of losing social acceptance. They might not care about others' well-being or engage in unwanted activities for the sake of another person. Their scepticism about others' intentions may give the impression that they are suspicious, unfriendly, and unwilling to cooperate. They may behave in a stubborn, confrontational, or even predatory manner. Such a person may be cold in contact, competitive, and aggressive. They may also display either a readable, rough communication style where 'you know where you stand', or be cunning and manipulative. <br /><br />
  <strong>OTHER CONCLUSIONS</strong><br />
  Agreeableness can be beneficial for building and maintaining relationships. Agreeable people are often more liked than antagonistic people. On the other hand, high agreeableness can interfere in situations requiring objective, unpopular, or simply difficult decisions. Highly agreeable people find themselves in community-oriented professions, such as teaching or care. People with low agreeableness can be good film critics, scientists, or soldiers. They will also perform well in professions related to 'things' - engineering and construction.
